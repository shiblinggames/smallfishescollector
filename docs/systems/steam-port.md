# The Steam port — PLAN

Converting Seas the Booty from a Vercel-hosted web game into a Steam game. Nothing here is
built yet. Read this before starting any of it, and read the system doc for whatever you are
touching alongside it.

**The decision, taken 2026-09-10: PREMIUM BUY-ONCE, AND STEAM ONLY.** One Steam price,
everything unlocked, gems earned only, no purchases inside the game at all. The web version
retires at launch and the iOS/Capacitor shell is not built. One client, one economy, one
place the game lives.

That makes this a conversion rather than a second SKU, which removes the two hardest things
about a port: there is no account-linking to maintain forever, and no second economy to keep
balanced against the first.

## Why that decision is the one that gates the rest

Steam requires purchases made inside a game to go through Steam's own payment. The two
real-money pipes today are the Captain membership and the gem packs, both Stripe, and neither
can survive in a Steam build. So the choice was never "which payment library" — it was which
of three games to ship, and the answer changes the DESIGN, not the checkout code:

- Every `isPremiumActive` gate stops gating. Sailing pacts need it on BOTH captains; homestead
  visits, the compass arrows and the crew disc all read it. Those become unconditional.
- The gem economy loses one of its two taps. Every gem SINK has to be re-checked against the
  earn rates alone, or the top of the game becomes unreachable rather than merely long.
- It also settles the philosophy question in the right direction. The house rule is evergreen,
  player-paced, never pay-to-win; a single price and no shop is the purest form of that, and
  premium sells better on Steam than free-to-play does.

## What Steam gives back

- **Steam Datagram Relay.** NAT traversal and relay fallback, free, over Valve's backbone.
  This is the answer to the scaling wall: the message bill that would reach five figures a
  month at ten thousand players becomes nothing, and there is no TURN server to run.
- **Verified identity.** A SteamID is authenticated by Steam, so the transport needs no JWT of
  its own and no re-implementation of the pact rules.
- **The social layer already exists.** Friends, invites, "Join Game" from the overlay. Pacts
  and mutual follows were built because the web had no friends list. Steam has one.
- **Achievements.** 249 badges with a registry, tiers and conditions already in one file.

## The order to do it in

Each phase is safe to stop after. Nothing below starts until the phase above is done, because
each one changes the assumptions the next is written against.

### 1. Take the money out of the game

The biggest design change and the one everything else sits on. Not the last step, the first.

- `isPremiumActive` returns true for everybody. Do NOT delete the call sites yet — flipping the
  helper is one line and reversible, deleting forty gates is neither.
- Audit every gem sink against earn-only rates. This is a real balance pass, not a search and
  replace.
- Strip the Stripe and Shopify checkout surfaces and webhooks from the client and the API.
- **Nobody paid.** Every membership on the live table was GRANTED, not bought, so there is no
  refund, no goodwill debt and no Steam keys to hand out. Stripe and Shopify can be deleted
  outright rather than disabled behind a flag: there is no purchase history to preserve and no
  webhook that must keep answering. Confirm the table before deleting, then delete.

### 2. Identity

Steam auth to Supabase session: the client gets an auth ticket from Steamworks, the server
verifies it with Valve, and mints a Supabase JWT. Everything behind it is unchanged, because
every value mutation already runs service-role behind RLS and does not care how you signed in.

**The one thing here that is a real decision: what happens to the players who already exist.**
The web retires, so roughly eighty accounts with fish, crew, badges and homesteads either come
across or do not. A one-time claim — sign in once with the old email, bind that row to a
SteamID — is cheap to build and is the kind thing to do for people who tested this for a year.
The alternative is that everybody starts again, which is defensible for a Steam launch and
should then be said out loud rather than discovered.

Note that this is the ONLY place old accounts matter. Everything else about identity gets
simpler: no linking to maintain, because after the claim window there is one way in.

### 3. The shell

Tauri or Electron around the existing app. The Capacitor plan already settled the pattern for
iOS — a remote-URL shell — and the same reasoning applies, because this game's value mutations
are all server actions and it is online-only by construction.

**The review risk is that it reads as a website in a box.** Native window, no browser chrome,
real fullscreen, bundled assets wherever possible, and honest failure states when the network
drops. Say "online only" on the store page rather than letting a reviewer discover it.

With the web retiring there is no longer a reason for the shell to point at a public URL at
all. Worth revisiting once phases 1 and 2 are done: assets can ship in the binary and only the
server actions need the network, which is a better product and a much better first impression
than a loading spinner over a browser.

### 4. Input, and the Deck

The largest single chunk of work and the easiest to underestimate. Controller support across
every panel, the dial, the raid aim bar, the gauntlets and 249 badge rows. Steam Deck
verification is worth targeting on purpose rather than hoping for.

### 5. Steam features

Achievements mapped off `lib/badges.ts` (close to one for one), rich presence, invites. Cloud
saves are a no-op: the save is already the database.

### 6. Multiplayer onto Steam networking

Replace the transport inside `lib/seaPresence.ts` with `ISteamNetworkingSockets`. Pacts and
mutual follows give way to Steam friends and invites.

**Everything above the transport carries over untouched** — the sender-clock velocity, the
interpolation buffer, the render lag, the stop beat. That layer took the longest to get right
and it does not care what carries it. See ocean-hub.md.

### 7. Compliance and the store

- **AI-generated content must be declared.** The art comes out of nano-banana and Kie.ai. This
  is a hard requirement at submission, not a formality.
- **Audit the casino before rating.** Blackjack, roulette, slots and a chip purse. Chips are
  bought with doubloons, which are earned — but trace every path from a PURCHASED currency to
  a chip and make sure none exists. Under premium buy-once there is no purchased currency at
  all, which is the cleanest possible answer, and that is worth confirming rather than
  assuming.
- $100 Steam Direct, 30% revenue share.

## What does not change

Supabase stays the authority for everything with value. The Pixi renderer, the chart, the
fishing dial, raids, gauntlets, the economy and every system doc in this folder are unaffected
by the port. This is a distribution and shell change with one design change at the front of it.

## Still open

- The price.
- Whether the eighty existing accounts get a one-time claim onto a SteamID, or everybody starts
  again. See phase 2.

## Settled, so nobody reopens them

- **Premium buy-once.** No shop, no membership, no purchased gems.
- **Steam only.** The web version retires at launch. The iOS/Capacitor shell is not built, and
  the plan for it is superseded by this document.
