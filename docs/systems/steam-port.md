# The Steam port — PARKED IDEA, NOT A PLAN

**Status: parked 2026-09-10, the same day it was written. THE GAME STAYS WEB-BASED.**

Nothing here is decided and nothing is being built. This is a worked-through idea kept because
the analysis in it cost something to produce and is still true — the scaling arithmetic, the
monetisation constraint, the phase ordering — and because it will be the starting point if this
ever comes back. Read it as "here is what we found when we looked at it", not as a set of
choices anybody made.

**Why it is parked.** A great deal of work has gone into making this a mobile and online
experience: the PWA, the touch chart, the phone layouts, the iOS plan, and a live multiplayer
presence system that only just started working properly. A Steam port throws most of that
away, and does it in exchange for problems the game does not have yet — the message bill that
motivated the whole conversation only bites at ten thousand players, and there are eighty
accounts today.

**What the port WOULD have required, if it ever happens.** These read like decisions below
because they were reasoned as decisions on the day. They are not in force:

- Premium buy-once, because Steam requires in-game purchases to go through Steam and the two
  Stripe pipes cannot survive a Steam build.
- Steam only, with the web retiring, because a second SKU means two economies and an
  account-linking flow to maintain forever.
- Which means the game design changes BEFORE the shell does. That ordering is the single most
  useful thing on this page and it is what makes the whole idea expensive.

## Why that decision is the one that gates the rest

Steam requires purchases made inside a game to go through Steam's own payment. The two
real-money pipes today are the Captain membership and the gem packs, both Stripe, and neither
can survive in a Steam build. So the choice was never "which payment library" — it was which
of three games to ship, and the answer changes the DESIGN, not the checkout code:

- Every `isPremiumActive` gate stops gating. Sailing pacts need it on BOTH captains; homestead
  visits, the compass arrows and the crew disc all read it. Those become unconditional.
- The gem economy loses one of its two taps. Every gem SINK has to be re-checked against the
  earn rates alone, or the top of the game becomes unreachable rather than merely long.
- It also settles the philosophy question in the right direction. The house rule is evergreen,
  player-paced, never pay-to-win; a single price and no shop is the purest form of that, and
  premium sells better on Steam than free-to-play does.

## What Steam gives back

- **Steam Datagram Relay.** NAT traversal and relay fallback, free, over Valve's backbone.
  This is the answer to the scaling wall: the message bill that would reach five figures a
  month at ten thousand players becomes nothing, and there is no TURN server to run.
- **Verified identity.** A SteamID is authenticated by Steam, so the transport needs no JWT of
  its own and no re-implementation of the pact rules.
- **The social layer already exists.** Friends, invites, "Join Game" from the overlay. Pacts
  and mutual follows were built because the web had no friends list. Steam has one.
- **Achievements.** 249 badges with a registry, tiers and conditions already in one file.

## Where development happens, and when it moves

**Development stays on the web until the game is content complete.** Decided 2026-09-10 with
the port itself.

The reason is the iteration loop and it is worth more than it looks. A push is live in three
minutes and a tester on any device sees it; a Steam build is a binary, an upload, a download
and a restart. Fifteen fixes in an afternoon — which is a real day on this project — is not
possible on the second one, and you cannot hot-fix a broken session while two people are
sitting in it. A game still finding its shape should not trade that away, and the current
testers are friends who tolerate breakage where a Steam playtest audience forms durable
impressions of an unfinished thing.

**But three of the phases below are not wrapper work, they change the GAME, and those happen
now, on the web, where the loop is fast:**

1. **Phase 1, taking the money out.** The most important thing on this page. It changes the
   BALANCE, so it needs months of play, not a week before submission. Finishing the web game
   with a premium economy and stripping it at the end means having balanced a game you are not
   shipping, and shipping an economy nobody has tested.
2. **Phase 4, controller support.** A design constraint dressed as a port task. Some panels
   will need rethinking rather than adapting, and that is cheap to find out now and expensive
   after another forty are built on the same assumptions.
3. **Retiring pacts** (part of phase 6). Steam friends replace them. No hurry, but do not build
   anything new on top of them.

Everything else — the shell, Steam auth, achievements, the networking swap — is mechanical,
gains nothing from early testing, and slows the loop if done early. The networking especially:
it replaces something that only just started working, and there is no reason to touch it twice.

**The risk is drift.** "We will port when it is done" runs forever. Two guards: write down what
content complete actually means, and spend about a week on a SHELL SPIKE soon — Tauri plus
Steamworks bindings, one window, auth working, nothing else. Not to adopt it; to prove the path
and surface the surprises while they are still free.

**What would change this:** if controller support turns out to force real UI redesigns rather
than adaptations, then the wrapper IS changing the game, and the shell should come early so the
design is aimed at the real target instead of guessing at it.

## Rhythm without a calendar

The target feel is Terraria and Stardew, and the single thing those two have in common is
worth stating plainly because it decides a dozen smaller questions:

**Neither of them has one mechanic keyed to the real-world calendar.** Stardew is FULL of
time — days, seasons, festivals, crops — and every bit of it is in-game time that only moves
while you play. Put the game down for two years and you have lost nothing. Terraria has day
and night, blood moons and invasions, and no daily reset anywhere. They have enormous rhythm
and zero calendar, and that is exactly why people trust them enough to sink hundreds of hours
into them.

This game currently keys almost everything to UTC: the daily challenges, the bounty board, the
free recruit, the gauntlet's one run, the trader rotation, even the sea's day and night. That
is a live-service shape. It is also in quiet tension with the house rule, which has always said
evergreen and player-paced and never FOMO — a daily that expires is a small FOMO mechanic, and
it is only there because free-to-play retention wanted it.

**So: move the rhythm out of the wall clock and into the session.** In value order:

1. **Boards restock by PLAYING, not by date.** Clear the daily challenges or the bounty board
   and a new one comes up. Same content, same loop, nothing missed, no reset. Mostly deleting
   date logic, and it is the highest-value change on this page after the money.
2. **The gauntlet's daily run becomes a resource you earn.** Roguelikes gate runs with supplies
   or a key, not with a calendar. The push-your-luck stake stays — a run still costs something
   — without the something being "come back tomorrow".
3. **The free recruit becomes a token you earn.** Same reasoning.
4. **Trawls and voyages are real-time timers**, which is a mobile mechanic. Stardew's crops grow
   over in-game days that pass in fourteen real minutes. Shorten them a lot, or tie them to
   play time.

**And one bigger prize, with a trap, which is why it goes LAST.** The sea's day and night
follows the real clock, so a captain who plays at two in the afternoon only ever sees
afternoon: there is a whole night palette most players will never see. Stardew gives you the
entire day arc every session and it is most of why it feels alive. Moving to session time would
show off art that is already built.

The trap is that sea traders are hashed off `(cell, day)` deterministically so that everybody
sees the same people on the same day. Untie time from the wall clock and that property breaks.
It matters less in a game where you sail with one friend rather than a shared world, but it is
a real coupling: read sea-npcs.md before touching the clock, and treat it as its own piece of
work rather than part of the boards.

## The order to do it in

Each phase is safe to stop after. Nothing below starts until the phase above is done, because
each one changes the assumptions the next is written against.

### 1. Take the money out of the game

The biggest design change and the one everything else sits on. Not the last step, the first.

- `isPremiumActive` returns true for everybody. Do NOT delete the call sites yet — flipping the
  helper is one line and reversible, deleting forty gates is neither.
- Audit every gem sink against earn-only rates. This is a real balance pass, not a search and
  replace.
- Strip the Stripe and Shopify checkout surfaces and webhooks from the client and the API.
- **Nobody paid.** Every membership on the live table was GRANTED, not bought, so there is no
  refund, no goodwill debt and no Steam keys to hand out. Stripe and Shopify can be deleted
  outright rather than disabled behind a flag: there is no purchase history to preserve and no
  webhook that must keep answering. Confirm the table before deleting, then delete.

### 2. Identity

Steam auth to Supabase session: the client gets an auth ticket from Steamworks, the server
verifies it with Valve, and mints a Supabase JWT. Everything behind it is unchanged, because
every value mutation already runs service-role behind RLS and does not care how you signed in.

**The one thing here that is a real decision: what happens to the players who already exist.**
The web retires, so roughly eighty accounts with fish, crew, badges and homesteads either come
across or do not. A one-time claim — sign in once with the old email, bind that row to a
SteamID — is cheap to build and is the kind thing to do for people who tested this for a year.
The alternative is that everybody starts again, which is defensible for a Steam launch and
should then be said out loud rather than discovered.

Note that this is the ONLY place old accounts matter. Everything else about identity gets
simpler: no linking to maintain, because after the claim window there is one way in.

### 3. The shell

Tauri or Electron around the existing app. The Capacitor plan already settled the pattern for
iOS — a remote-URL shell — and the same reasoning applies, because this game's value mutations
are all server actions and it is online-only by construction.

**The review risk is that it reads as a website in a box.** Native window, no browser chrome,
real fullscreen, bundled assets wherever possible, and honest failure states when the network
drops. Say "online only" on the store page rather than letting a reviewer discover it.

With the web retiring there is no longer a reason for the shell to point at a public URL at
all. Worth revisiting once phases 1 and 2 are done: assets can ship in the binary and only the
server actions need the network, which is a better product and a much better first impression
than a loading spinner over a browser.

### 4. Input, and the Deck

The largest single chunk of work and the easiest to underestimate. Controller support across
every panel, the dial, the raid aim bar, the gauntlets and 249 badge rows. Steam Deck
verification is worth targeting on purpose rather than hoping for.

### 5. Steam features

Achievements mapped off `lib/badges.ts` (close to one for one), rich presence, invites. Cloud
saves are a no-op: the save is already the database.

### 6. Multiplayer onto Steam networking

Replace the transport inside `lib/seaPresence.ts` with `ISteamNetworkingSockets`. Pacts and
mutual follows give way to Steam friends and invites.

**Everything above the transport carries over untouched** — the sender-clock velocity, the
interpolation buffer, the render lag, the stop beat. That layer took the longest to get right
and it does not care what carries it. See ocean-hub.md.

### 7. Compliance and the store

- **AI-generated content must be declared.** The art comes out of nano-banana and Kie.ai. This
  is a hard requirement at submission, not a formality.
- **Audit the casino before rating.** Blackjack, roulette, slots and a chip purse. Chips are
  bought with doubloons, which are earned — but trace every path from a PURCHASED currency to
  a chip and make sure none exists. Under premium buy-once there is no purchased currency at
  all, which is the cleanest possible answer, and that is worth confirming rather than
  assuming.
- $100 Steam Direct, 30% revenue share.

## What does not change

Supabase stays the authority for everything with value. The Pixi renderer, the chart, the
fishing dial, raids, gauntlets, the economy and every system doc in this folder are unaffected
by the port. This is a distribution and shell change with one design change at the front of it.

## Still open

- The price.
- Whether the eighty existing accounts get a one-time claim onto a SteamID, or everybody starts
  again. See phase 2.

## What is NOT decided

Everything above. In particular, and stated flatly because the earlier draft of this document
said the opposite:

- **The web version is not retiring.** It is the game.
- **The iOS/Capacitor plan is not cancelled.** It is still the live plan for mobile.
- **Nothing about the monetisation is settled.** The Captain membership and the gem packs are
  live and stay live.

## The one finding here that is NOT about Steam

The gem audit stands on its own and is a live balance question either way. All 75 crew skins
cost 113,750 gems against roughly 13,500 gems of one-off income, so the collection is only
reachable today because gems are PURCHASABLE. That is worth looking at as a balance matter
whatever platform this ships on. See economy-membership.md.
